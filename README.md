# gist-to-boostnote

Create [Boostnote](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote)s from your gists.

### Why?

Although [Gist Service](https://gist.github.com) is a great cloud platform for your notes/snippets, you can't organize them properly as it doesn't have such required features like smart search and tagging. I switched from Gist to Boostnote, which promotes these features by default. However, I didn't want to copy and paste all the gists, chose writing a small script for those who have similar considerations instead.

### Requirements

* Python > 3.5 or Docker.

### Usage
